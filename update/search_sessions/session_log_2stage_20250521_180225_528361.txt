--- Final Text-to-CAD Specification Output ---
**Project Name:** Custom Lightweight GPS Mount for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)

**1. Base Component & Overall Design Intent:**
   * **Target Device:** GPS module (Generic, compatible with UAVs)
   * **Enclosure/Mount Type:** A lightweight mounting bracket specifically designed for 3D printing.
   * **Primary Objective:** Securely mount the GPS module to a UAV, fabricated from 3D printed PLA/PETG, while prioritizing a lightweight design and avoiding sharp external edges.

**2. Materials & Construction:**
   * **Primary Material (Prioritize user choice, then research):** 3D Printed PLA or PETG (user specified preference).
   * **Wall Thickness/Material Gauge (From user input, research, or best practice):** Thickness of 2mm, a common choice for lightweight 3D printed drone components.
   * **Recommended Color (From user input, research, or functional suggestion):** Natural color of the filament (translucent or semi-opaque), which is a common standard for printed parts unless specified otherwise.

**3. Detailed Geometry and Form (Prioritize user input and specific research details):**
   * **Overall Form Factor Description:** A streamlined, low-profile bracket that accommodates the GPS module while minimizing weight. The design aims to integrate seamlessly with the UAV structure and ensure the GPS module is securely held.
   * **Key Geometric Features:**
        * **GPS Module Housing:** A rectangular recess measuring 40mm x 30mm x 10mm, designed to fit a generic UAV GPS module snugly. Internal corners radiused to 1mm to avoid sharp edges.
        * **Mounting Interface to UAV:** The bracket includes a base flange measuring 60mm x 50mm x 2mm thick with two 3.2mm diameter through-holes for M3 screws, spaced 50mm apart, and countersunk to accommodate the screws.
   * **Edge Treatments:** All external edges will be filleted (3mm radius) to comply with the user requirement of avoiding sharp edges.
   * **Lightweighting Features:** Integrate lightweight hexagonal cutouts (10mm across flats) along non-load-bearing areas of the flange to reduce weight while maintaining structural integrity.
   * **Surface Finish Suggestion:** Standard matte finish typical of 3D printed PLA/PETG parts, which helps reduce weight while providing a clean look.

**4. Component Dimensions:**
   * **GPS Module Dimensions (User-specified or from research):** Assumed standard GPS module size: approximately 40mm x 30mm x 10mm.
   * **Overall Bracket/Enclosure Approximate Dimensions (L x W x H):** Approximately 60mm x 50mm x 20mm (including height for the mounted GPS module).

**5. Active/Passive Cooling:** N/A - Not required for this component type based on research and common usage.

**6. Ventilation:** N/A - Open bracket design, dedicated ventilation not required.

**7. Port Access Cutouts (Specific to GPS Module):**
   * Include a rectangular cutout measuring 6mm x 4mm positioned to allow access for a standard connector plug on the GPS module.

**8. Mounting to UAV (Based on user input):**
   * **Method:** Direct screw mount to UAV frame using existing M3 screw holes.
   * **Fasteners:** Requires two M3 x [User to Specify Length Based on Frame] mm screws, to securely attach the GPS mount to the UAV.

**9. Assembly:** Single-piece design requires no assembly; simply print and mount.

**10. Cable Management:**
   * Two small integrated loops (1.5mm wide, 4mm long slots) on the underside for zip-tying the GPS module cable, ensuring a tidy installation.

**11. Additional Design Considerations & Constraints (User-specified or critical research findings):**
   * The design must ensure that the GPS antenna remains unobstructed for a clear view of the sky, enhancing signal reception. The lightweight and simple fastening system should facilitate easy access for adjustments if required.
